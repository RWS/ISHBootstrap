# Examples Change log

- Script `UnInstall-ISH.ps1` first tries to use **ISHDeploy** and then falls back into looking for input parameter files droped by  `Install-ISH.ps1`.
- Scripts are now powered by deployment names instead of suffix.
- Scripts that seed the ISHCD have now two permutations `Copy-ISHCD.Released.ps1` and `Copy-ISHCD.NotReleased.ps1`.
  - `Copy-ISHCD.NotReleased.ps1` is for internal releases. This is for **internal** use only.
  - `Copy-ISHCD.Released.ps1` is powered by an FTP.

- Seperated **Examples** specific changes from the main changelog.  

**20160816**

- In example 'Install-Module.ps1' when working locally, the script will load automatically from the source. No need to publish xISHServer or xISHInstall.
- New configuration scripts in examples. `Set-ISHSTSWindows.ps1` and `Set-UIFeatures.ImplicitRemoting.ps1` to enable the light weight windows authentication on top of ISHSTS. Scripts will make sure that IIS has the the module installed.
