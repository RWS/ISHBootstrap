**20161017**

- Due to ISHDeploy's upcoming cmdlet renaming and tutorial changes the `Set-ISHUIFeatures.ps1` was split into
  - `Set-ISHCMComponents.ps1`
  - `Set-ISHCMMenuAndButton.ps1`

**20161011**

To align with the major changes in Source:

- Added new supported property in JSON `CredentialExpression` that drives authorization for all remote calls.
- `Initialize-ISHServer.ps1` checks if the target operating system is supported by this bootstrapper.
- Improved the configuration scripts
  - When the value is localized, the value is read from the json file
  - Changes in the required parameters for each configuration script. Check [How to use the repository (Examples)](Topics\How to use the repository (Examples).md)
  - Split the ADFS integration in two files 
    - `Set-ISHIntegrationADFS.ps1` configures the ADFS artifacts on ISH.
    - `Set-ADFSIntegrationISH.ps1` configures the ISH artifacts on ADFS. **Known issue** when the remote ish server is not in the same domain as with the client. The implicit variant **works**.
  - `Set-InternalAuthentication.ps1` enables the internal authentication flow.
  - `Set-ISHSTSRelyingParty.ps1` adds relying parties to ISHSTS.
  - `Set-ISHSTSWindows.ps1` enables windows authentication on ISHSTS.

**Known Issues**

- When executing against a remote server that is not in the same domain, certain copy actions will not be supported when the client is powered by PowerShell v.4 because the `Copy-Item` doesn't accept specific credentials. 
  - `Set-ADFSIntegrationISH.ImplicitRemoting.ps1` will break

**20160825**

- `Invoke-ISHDeployScript.ps1` and `Invoke-Pester.ps1` will skip script references that do not exist. Temporary commenting mechanism.
- New `Invoke-Pester.ps1` to execute pester tests.

**20160819**

- Script `UnInstall-ISH.ps1` first tries to use **ISHDeploy** and then falls back into looking for input parameter files dropped by  `Install-ISH.ps1`.
- Scripts are now powered by deployment names instead of suffix.
- Scripts that seed the ISHCD have now two permutations `Copy-ISHCD.Released.ps1` and `Copy-ISHCD.NotReleased.ps1`.
  - `Copy-ISHCD.NotReleased.ps1` is for internal releases. This is for **internal** use only.
  - `Copy-ISHCD.Released.ps1` is powered by an FTP. 

**20160818**

- Separated **Examples** specific changes from the main changelog.  

**20160816**

- In example 'Install-Module.ps1' when working locally, the script will load automatically from the source. No need to publish xISHServer or xISHInstall.
- New configuration scripts in examples. `Set-ISHSTSWindows.ps1` and `Set-UIFeatures.ImplicitRemoting.ps1` to enable the light weight windows authentication on top of ISHSTS. Scripts will make sure that IIS has the the module installed.
