    Quote from his email
    I recommend to install Visual C++ 2010 prior installing AntennaHouse. This is a prereq of Antennahouse and I’ve seen different results if this is not installed (the installer is trying to install it for you but the user has to accept the Microsoft Agreement)

    Steps:

    1.	Create an setup answer file: example: V6-3-R1a-Windows_X86_32E.exe –r
    2.	File is created in the Windows folder: setup.iss
    3.	Copy this file in the same location as the AntennaHouse installer
    4.	Execute V6-3-R1a-Windows_X86_32E.exe /S /f1.\setup.iss
    5.	AntennaHouse is automatically installed
