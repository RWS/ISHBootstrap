            The goal is to align the Crawler's index with the database store
            Since we don't know anything about the database's origin, we will issue a reindex when the stack is created.
            If consecutive executions happen from the same host, then the reindex will happen only the first time.
            If the host dies unexpectedly, when replaced by a new instance, although unnecessary the reindex will be triggered because there no information.
