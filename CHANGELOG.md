## Before pre-release v0.2

**20161011**

- Major code refactoring. **Before** this all code expected to access and execute remote code without specifying credential. This worked for domain credentials. 
  - Improved the `Add-ModuleFromRemote.ps1` to accept a `-Credential` parameter. 
  - Improved the `Invoke-CommandWrap.ps1` to accept a `-Credential` parameter. 
  - All scripts accept a `-Credential` parameter.
- **xISHServer** is now smarter:
  - `Get-ISHOSInfo` breaks down the information from the caption of the operating system.
  - `Get-ISHNETInfo` returns .NET available .NET versions.
  - `Get-ISHCOMPlus` returns COM+ applications and their state.
  - `Test-ISHServerCompliance` checks if the target operating system is supported by this bootstrapper.
    - Windows Server 2016.
    - Windows Server 2012 R2.
    - Windows Server 10.
    - Windows Server 8.1 **not tested though**.
  - `Install-ISHVisualBasicRuntime` installs the Visual Basic Runtime SP6. Requires file `vbrun60sp6.exe`. Get it from [Service Pack 6 for Visual Basic 6.0: Run-Time Redistribution Pack (vbrun60sp6.exe)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24417) and then extract. **Use only** with Windows Server 2016 core variant. **This is a workaround**. [More information](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/9b0f8911-07f4-420f-9e48-d31915f91528/msvbvm60dll-missing-in-core?forum=winservercore).

- Script `Test-SupportedServer.ps1` checks if the target operating system is supported by this bootstrapper.

**Known Issues**

- When executing against a remote server that is not in the same domain, certain copy actions will not be supported when the client is powered by PowerShell v.4 because the `Copy-Item` doesn't accept specific credentials.
